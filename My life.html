<p style="position: relative; left: 24%; font-size: 20px; width: 800px;">Without getting too much into it, I reside in a small country town 6 hours from school in Connecticut. Some may say its the birthing ground of our lord and savior Jesus Christ,, of course, usually I am the only person to say that but it doesnt fit my narrative too well if I'm alone in this borderline blasphemy.
    I have a Dog named Reilly, who im convinced has developed some sort of unexplainable dog schizophrenia in his 10 long years. It may be a little cynical of me to say this, I'm sure his hasty bounds to the back door whenever we get up off of the couch are because he loves us. NOT because he sees some scary ten foot tall monster in the backyard.</p>
