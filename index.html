    <p>I enjoy reading, playing games, and long walks on the beach. I dont have any kids,, although the wife and I are
    trying (fingers crossed). My main aspirations are to write commercials and work in the creative side of business. I
    know nothing about coding or making aesthetically pleasing web pages although you may be amazed at just how well
    this turns out.</p>
